This repository is comprised by two different projects, which both of them are focused in CNN architecture of ML.
Binary classification is focused to distinguish people with happy/sad emotions, based on their face mimics and other body gestures caught in image. Trained in a relatively small dataset of around 300 images, resulted with a 95% accuracy in training set.
Multiclass classification try to identify one of 10 real-world objects given in a built in dataset of tensorflow.keras. Resulted in a accuracy of 75% in training set, and 72% in validation set.
